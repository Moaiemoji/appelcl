    <h1>Appel Challenge List Rules</h1>
    </header>
    <h1>Basic Rules</h1>
    <p>
    Level must be completed in 30FPS in Scratch or TurboWarp.<br>
    Levels must have a valid replay with their completion.<br>
    All levels submitted must be possible, verified (with a replay code), and have a level code or link to a mod where it is playable.<br>
    Level replays SHOULD NOT be TASsed. TASing levels is banned on the leaderboard.<br>
    The replay code should include YOUR username, it should not be an exact duplicate of another replay.<br>
    Levels must be played LIVE, or with a valid replay code with a screenshot of the live end-screen.<br>
    (This is to prevent cheating, like copying replay codes and showing the video, with it not being your completion.)<br>
